In a relational database all information is organized into tables
Data is represented as a collection of relations 
A table structure consists of a name and column names; 
each row is a collecion of related data
Rows are called tuples
Columns are referred to as attributes
Tables are referred to as relations
Domain refers to a data type
Domains can be thought of as a set of atomic values
Degree is the number of attributes 
Relational schema R = contain attributes such that (A1, A2,..,AN)
Relation state is a set of tuples that consititute the relation
The set of tuples is unordered
NULL values are allowed but can be problematic because there is no context
Constraints are restrictions on the actual values allowed in the database
Inherent or implicit  model based constraints are part of the data model itself
No two tuples can be identical*
A superkey is a subset of attributes such that no 2 tuples are identical
A key is a sueprkey where removing an attributes makes it not a superkey anymore
Candiate key may have more than 1 key unique to attributes
Primary key the candidate key chosen to designate unique entries
Foreign keys relate to primary keys of other relations
Primary Keys may consist of more than 1 attributes
Referential Integrity Constraint; a foreign key must exist within that table
Basic operations are insert update and delete
Insertion and deletion may not be valid depending on constraints
Inserting or deleting may not be valid based on primary or foreign keys
Updating primary or foreign keys will have the same problems
